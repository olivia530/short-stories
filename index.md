## Who this guide is for

This guide was written specifically for students in college-level introductory creative writing courses. However, anyone who wants to get better at writing fiction but doesn't quite know where to start may benefit from reading this.

## Why read short stories?

Short stories are a great form for the beginning writer, both to practice reading and to practice writing. One benefit is their brevity: while it can take days or even weeks to read an entire novel, most short stories can be read in thirty minutes or less. It doesn't take long to become familiar with the moves writers make when constructing a short story. 

Because short stories are so, well, short, they also tend to be quite efficient--they move from beginning to middle to end in a much smaller number of words than novels do, and so they provide a compressed, speedy way to observe the mechanics of storytelling in action. 

Finally, short stories are a lot of fun! I think many writers view short stories as opportunities to experiment, to try wild ideas or formal explorations that might not be sustainable for the course of a whole book.

## Reading as a writer: what it is and isn't

The experience of reading a short story is different than reading, say, a scientific research paper, or a newspaper article. And reading as a writer is also different than reading purely for enjoyment. There are certain unique and specific aspects of the reading process that we prioritize when we read as writers, because not only are we trying to understand what we read, but we're also trying to learn something from it.

The steps that follow below may seem like overkill if you're new to reading as a writer, but rest assured that they will ensure you get the most out of every short story you read. With a little practice, these approaches to reading will become automatic.

## The first read: absorb

Let's say you have a short story that you'd like to read as a writer. The first time you read that story, don't try to learn anything from it. Instead, just **absorb** it.

At this stage in the process, you are just getting a sense for the story. Notice your emotional responses to it, take heed of whether you liked it or didn't like it, and think of other works it might remind you of. Try reading some of the sentences out loud, to hear and feel the shape of the words--the sonic experience of a story can be just as impactful as the visual one. 

Take as much or as little time as you want during this stage. Here, you are just trying to enjoy reading the piece for its own sake, before you dig into what makes it tick.

## The second read: understand

On this read, you're going to dig a little deeper. I recommend completing this step with a pen or pencil in hand, or a notes document open if you're reading digitally.

Here you are going back through the story and making sure you **understand** it. It's easy to miss a lot of small details on an initial read for absorption, which is the level at which most regular readers stop. But as writers, we want to think about this story on a deeper level. We need to understand what happens in it and why it's working the way it works. To do that, we have to notice any points of confusion and think through them.

As you read, take notes on what's happening in the story--you can write down a bulleted list of story events or plot points, or write a paragraph-long summary of the story. Circle any words or phrases you don't know and look them up in a dictionary. If the story mentions any locations, objects, historical figures, or other details with which you are unfamiliar, look those up as well.

Something I like to do when I read a short story is write down its first and last sentences. Thinking about how the writer of the story got from one sentence to another is a great way to jumpstart my own creativity--how would I have connected these two points if the story was my own to write?

Make sure you have the order of events in the story straight in your mind. This is especially important for stories that incorporate flashbacks or are told in non-chronological order. You might also want to jot down some notes about the form this story takes and the storytelling choices the author makes: for example, is it told in first-person or third-person point of view? Is it made up of lengthy sentences or short, clipped paragraphs? Does it span many years or a single hour? Glean as much information as you can about the story before moving on. No detail is too small.

As you wrap up this stage of reading, write down a list of any questions you still have. You'll need those questions for what comes next.

## The third read: interpret

During this stage of reading, you are going to draw on all the information you just gathered about the story and weave connections between those pieces of knowledge to build a complete mental picture of what the story does. This may sound like a challenging task--but if you've done a thorough job of understanding the story in the previous stage, you'll be off to a good start.

Something crucial to understand here is the difference between what **happens** in a story versus what the story **means.** What happens in a story is the literal situation on the page, the facts of the story--in other words, all the stuff you just took note of during your second read. But what the story is *about* is everything below the surface thematically and emotionally. It's the stuff that's *not* on the page. It's the stuff that it's our job as writers to pick up on and interpret.

Go back to the list of questions that you wrote down at the end of the previous reading stage. Using what you now know about this story, what would you guess are the answers to these questions? It's OK if you come up with multiple answers for a single question--in fact, you probably will for most questions. This ambiguity is a crucial part of any creative work, and short stories are no exception. It's now up to you to decide which of these answers makes the most sense, based on *your* personal understanding of the story.

{: .tip }
When I'm interpreting a short story, I often consider *counterfactuals*--questions that ask how the story would differ if one key element was changed. For example, "How would my understanding of the main character's mood differ if the author had described the weather as sunny instead of cold and windy?" Thinking about counterfactuals can help you understand the intention behind certain storytelling choices by comparing them against the other choices the author could have made, but didn't.

At this stage, you will begin to think like a writer: someone who uses the tools of language to lay out an intentional pattern of words that communicates a message to readers. By interpreting the story at this level of depth, you are putting yourself in the author's shoes, simulating in your own mind the sorts of choices and questions that the author had to consider while writing. It is this interpretive work that helps you practice the skills you'll need to write your own stories.
