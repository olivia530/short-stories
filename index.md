# Why read short stories?

Short stories are a great form for the beginning writer, both to practice reading and to practice writing. One benefit is their brevity: while it can take days or even weeks to read an entire novel, most short stories can be read in thirty minutes or less. It doesn't take long to become familiar with the moves writers make when constructing a short story. 

Because short stories are so, well, short, they also tend to be quite efficient--they move from beginning to middle to end in a much smaller number of words than novels do, and so they provide a compressed, speedy way to observe the mechanics of storytelling in action. 

Finally, short stories are a lot of fun! I think many writers view short stories as opportunities to experiment, to try wild ideas or formal explorations that might not be sustainable for the course of a whole book.

# Reading as a writer: what it is and isn't

The experience of reading a short story is different than reading, say, a scientific research paper, or a newspaper article. And reading as a writer is also different than reading purely for enjoyment. There are certain unique and specific aspects of the reading process that we prioritize when we read as writers, because not only are we trying to understand what we read, but we're also trying to learn something from it.

The steps that follow below may seem like overkill if you're new to reading as a writer, but rest assured that they will ensure you get the most out of every short story you read. With a little practice, these approaches to reading will become automatic.

# The first read: absorb

Let's say you have a short story that you'd like to read as a writer. The first time you read that story, don't try to learn anything from it. Instead, just **absorb** it.

At this stage in the process, you are just getting a sense for the story. Notice your emotional responses to it, take heed of whether you liked it or didn't like it, and think of other works it might remind you of. Try reading some of the sentences out loud, to hear and feel the shape of the words. Here, you are just trying to enjoy reading the piece for its own sake, before you dig into what makes it tick.

Something I like to do when I read a short story is write down its first and last sentences. Thinking about how the writer of the story got from one sentence to another is a great way to jumpstart my own creativity--how would I have connected these two points if the story was my own to write?


# The second read: understand

Now we're going to dig a little deeper. One of the most important things to pay attention to when we're reading as writers is what *happens* in the story, versus what the story is *about.*

Going off the Paulette Alden reading, who can tell me what these two concepts are and how they're different? You might want to look at page 4 and 5.

So we can see that what *happens* in a story is the literal situation on the page, the facts of the story. But what the story is *about* is everything below the surface thematically and emotionally. It's the stuff that's *not* on the page. It's the stuff that it's our job as writers to pick up on and interpret.

Reading in this way means paying close enough attention to the story that we can fully understand both what *happens* in a story and what it's *about.*

We are going to close read this story from the beginning, and we are going to try to pick up as much information as we can. We are going to look for the stuff that's *not* on the page.
