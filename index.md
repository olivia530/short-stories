# How to Read Short Stories as a Writer

Welcome! This page is a guide to one of the foundational skills for anyone who wants to write fiction: how to read short stories. Reading short stories using a few key techniques is one of the best ways to learn how to write, even if you're a complete beginner. In this guide, you'll learn how to apply these techniques to any story you want to learn from.

# Why read short stories?

Short stories are a great form for the beginning writer, both to practice reading and to practice writing. One benefit is their brevity: while it can take days or even weeks to read an entire novel, most short stories can be read in thirty minutes or less. It doesn't take long to become familiar with the moves writers make when constructing a short story. 

Because short stories are so, well, short, they also tend to be quite efficient--they move from beginning to middle to end in a much smaller number of words than novels do, and so they provide a compressed, speedy way to observe the mechanics of storytelling in action. 

Finally, short stories are a lot of fun! I think many writers view short stories as opportunities to experiment, to try wild ideas or formal explorations that might not be sustainable for the course of a whole book.

# Reading as a writer: what it is and isn't

The experience of reading a short story is different than reading, say, a scientific research paper, or a newspaper article. And reading as a writer is also different than purely reading for enjoyment. There are certain unique and specific aspects of the reading process that we prioritize when we read as writers.

So we might say that when we're reading as consumers, we are just getting a sense for the story. We're noticing our emotional responses to it, whether we liked it or didn't like it, what other works it might remind us of. Here we are just trying to enjoy the reading of the piece for its own sake, before we attempt to learn anything from it.

Now we're going to dig a little deeper. One of the most important things to pay attention to when we're reading as writers is what *happens* in the story, versus what the story is *about.*

Going off the Paulette Alden reading, who can tell me what these two concepts are and how they're different? You might want to look at page 4 and 5.

So we can see that what *happens* in a story is the literal situation on the page, the facts of the story. But what the story is *about* is everything below the surface thematically and emotionally. It's the stuff that's *not* on the page. It's the stuff that it's our job as writers to pick up on and interpret.

Reading in this way means paying close enough attention to the story that we can fully understand both what *happens* in a story and what it's *about.*

We are going to close read this story from the beginning, and we are going to try to pick up as much information as we can. We are going to look for the stuff that's *not* on the page.
